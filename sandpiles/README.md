# Sandpiles Problem in C

## Overview

The Sandpiles problem is a classic example in computational theory and physics, illustrating the concept of self-organized criticality. In this project, we simulate a sandpile model where grains of sand are added to a grid, causing the system to evolve and reach a stable state.

## Features

- Simulate the addition of sand grains to a grid.
- Automatically distribute sand grains when a pile exceeds a certain threshold.
- Visualize the final state of the sandpile.

## Requirements

- C compiler (GCC recommended)
