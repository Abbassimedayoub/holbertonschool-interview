## Introduction

At Holberton School, preparing for technical interviews is crucial for our education and career development. This repository serves as a platform for students to practice and refine their algorithmic problem-solving skills. Each week, a new problem is assigned and solved using both Python and C, demonstrating proficiency in both high-level and low-level programming concepts.

## Weekly Problem Solving

Every week, a new problem statement is provided. Students are required to:

- Analyze the problem requirements and constraints.
- Develop a solution in both Python and C.
- Ensure the solution is efficient, adhering to best practices and performance considerations.
- Document their approach and thought process in a clear and concise manner.

Problem solutions are organized into directories corresponding to each week's problem, allowing easy navigation and reference.

## Languages Used

- **Python**: A high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used in rapid application development and scripting.
- **C**: A low-level programming language known for its efficiency and direct control over hardware. C is foundational in systems programming and embedded systems development.

Both languages are essential for any aspiring software engineer, providing a comprehensive understanding of programming paradigms and methodologies.
